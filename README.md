## About This Survey
This paper providing a systematic review of the development of language modeling for tabular data, encompassing: 
* a categorization of different tabular data structures and data types;
* a review of key datasets used in model training and tasks used for evaluation;
* a summary of modeling techniques including widely-adopted data processing methods, popular architectures, and training objectives;
* the evolution from adapting traditional Pre-training/Pre-trained language models to the utilization of large language models;
* an identification of persistent challenges and potential future research directions in language modeling for tabular data analysis.
